# UWC Blogs

_A collection of over 470 blogs written by UWC students in 33 languages from 81 countries at the 18 United World Colleges._

When I started UWC Blogs in 2013, I intended to give UWC applicants a glimpse into life at UWC. At the time I was waiting impatiently to start my own UWC experience at [UWC Waterford Kamhlaba](https://uwcblogs.com/uwc-waterford-kamhlaba). I had soaked up every bit of UWC promotional material, but I still couldn't quite imagine what UWC would be like. So I read through every blog about UWC I could find and eventually created [UWC Blogs](https://uwcblogs.com) to share the blogs with other UWC hopefuls.

I strive to make the list as extensive as possible so that everybody can find a blog for their favorite college in their native language. This wouldn't be possible without you. Thanks to everybody who submitted a blog! Do you blog about UWC or know a blog that isn't listed here? [Submit the link](https://uwcblogs.com/submit).

[UWC Blogs](https://uwcblogs.com) is powered by [Astro DB](https://studio.astro.build/) and built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and a lot of ðŸ’™.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
